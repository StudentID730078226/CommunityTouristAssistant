Design Patterns and Justifications
==================================

Polymorphic Model Pattern
-------------------------

``Place`` is a polymorphic base model with subtype models such as ``HeritagePlace``,
``FoodPlace``, ``ActivityPlace``, and ``BeachPlace``.

Why used:

- Shared fields stay centralized.
- Type-specific fields stay clean and explicit.
- UI can render subtype details without large conditional model structures.

Repository via ORM + Query Composition
--------------------------------------

Django ORM querysets are composed in views for search, moderation queues, and detail pages.

Why used:

- Improves readability of filtering and sorting logic.
- Allows incremental optimization via annotations and indexes.
- Keeps SQL portability while still supporting query plan verification.

Audit Trail Pattern
-------------------

``ModerationLog`` records moderation actions with actor, action type, target object, and timestamp.

Why used:

- Provides accountability for admin actions.
- Supports governance/reporting requirements.
- Helps explain content state changes during stakeholder demos.

Soft Delete Pattern
-------------------

Places and reviews use archive fields instead of hard deletes.

Why used:

- Preserves moderation evidence.
- Enables reversible operations (restore).
- Reduces risk of accidental data loss.

Progressive Trust Pattern
-------------------------

Contribution points and review restrictions provide graduated control.

Why used:

- Encourages healthy participation.
- Adds non-binary moderation responses.
- Scales better than manual intervention alone.
