Moderation Workflow
===================

Place Moderation
----------------

1. Users submit places in pending state.
2. Admin approves/rejects/archives submissions.
3. Actions are recorded in ``ModerationLog``.

Review Moderation
-----------------

1. Users report reviews.
2. Admin upholds or dismisses reports.
3. Upheld reports can penalize contribution score and restrict posting.
4. Actions are recorded in ``ModerationLog``.

Soft Delete Strategy
--------------------

- ``Place`` and ``Review`` support archive fields.
- Admin delete paths archive items instead of hard delete.
- Archived content is excluded from public-facing queries.
